Fastest Snappy compression library in Node.js, powered by [napi-rs](https://napi.rs) and [rust-snappy](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-snappy).

> For small size data, [snappyjs](https://github.com/zhipeng-jia/snappyjs) is faster, and it support browser. But it doesn't have async API, which is important for Node.js program.

## Install this package

```
yarn add snappy
```
